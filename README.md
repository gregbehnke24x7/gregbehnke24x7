Hello,

I’m Greg Behnke and this is my repo.  I’m a professional software analyst and have been working with technology
in one form or another for quite a while.  I first learned how to write programs on a Tandy TRS-80 before taking
a class in BASIC in high school.  From there I went into the Navy, where I learned about electronics theory,
digital circuits, vacuum tubes, RADAR, electro-mechanics, hydraulics, ballistics, and so much more as a Fire Controlman.
I first worked on the NATO SeaSparrow missile system on the USS Seattle AOE-3 before being assigned as a re-commissioning
crewmember to the battleship Wisconsin BB-64.  On Wisconsin (or Wisky as she is lovingly known) I worked as a MK 38 NGFCS
technician for ‘the big guns’, the 16”/50 caliber Naval rifles the Iowa class is so famous for.  Fun fact: I am a plankowner
on USS Wisconsin!

All these experiences have given me a passion for solving complex problems and helping my shipmates…err, teammates.
My latest passion is the field of Data Science because this area has tremendous potential to leverage the ‘fruits’ of
the information revolution in ways that will fundamentally improve the human condition.  Machine learning for the win!
